This repository contains a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for day planning from a list in a Markdown note. 

> This is an early alpha of version of the plugin and it will be running constantly in the background while Obsidian is open and the plugin is enabled. **Please try the plugin in a test vault first, and, most importantly, make sure you have your notes backed up in cloud storage or Git.**
    
## Features

- Uses your daily Obsidian note to generate a day plan.
- Does not mutate your note.
- Status bar updates on progress with information on your current and next tasks. You can click on the status bar to access the note for today's day planner.
- Timeline view showing your tasks laid out on a vertical timeline.

## Usage

Once installed, the plugin will read your daily note as configured by you to display your daily plan.

### Day Planner Note

Within the note, you can create a list of times and tasks which will be automatically be tracked during the day. You can include headings and other content between tasks. Here is an example:

<!-- TODO -->
```markdown
## Day Planner

This is my plan for the day broken into 3 main sections:
1. Morning Prep
2. Reading
3. Afternoon Review

### Morning Prep

This is where I get ready for work and do my usual prep.

- [ ] 09:30 Setup for work
- [ ] 09:45 Review notes from yesterday
- [ ] 10:30 Create new notes for #article review
- 11:30 BREAK

### Reading

A section of the day dedicated to reading:

1. Articles.
2. Book chapters assigned for the day.
3. Re-reading past notes.
   
- [ ] 12:00 Reading
  - [ ] Article 1
  - [ ] Article 2
  - [ ] Article notes review
- 12:25 BREAK
- [ ] 12:30 Reading
- 14:00 BREAK

### Afternoon Review

I use this time to review what I have done earlier in the day and complete any tasks to prepare for the next day.

- [ ] 15:00 Review notes and update daily note [[20201103]]
- [ ] 15:45 Walk
- [ ] 16:30 Reading
- [ ] 17:20 Prep for tomorrow's meetings
- 18:00 END
```

The `Day Planner` heading and `---` rule are used to identify the extent of the Day Planner. A heading must be used but can be `#`, `##`, `###` or `####`.

The format of the task list items is important as this is what is used to calculate the times of each task and the intervals between tasks. The format must be one of:

 `- HH:mm Task text` 
 `- [ ] HH:mm Task text`
 
 **24 hour times must be used.** 

 Nested checklist items or bullets are now also supported to capture sub-tasks of a timed task. Timed tasks must be at the top level of the checkbox list.

 `BREAK` and `END` are keywords that define breaks and the end to the time tracking for the tasks. They are not case sensitive so `break` and `end` can also be used.

 `END` is used as an item with a time to give an accurate time interval for the last task, *"Prep for tomorrow's meetings"* at 17:00 in this example.

### Timeline View

The `Show the Day Planner Timeline` command can be used to add a vertical timeline view display the tasks for today's Day Planner with a line showing the current time.

### Status Bar

The status bar in Obsidian will also show the current progress on the task or break with the time remaining. Clicking on the status bar item will take you to the Day Planner note.

#### Task Status

The status displayed when there is an active task:

![End Status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lynchjames/obsidian-day-planner/main/images/end-status.png)

## Configuration

### Status Bar - Circular Progress

You can choose to display progress in the status bar with a circular pie chart progress bar to save horizontal space.

### Task Notification
